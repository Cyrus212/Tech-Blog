# Tech-Blog

## Description
I built this blog site to create a platform where developers can publish technical articles and engage with other developers. As a student learning web development, I wanted a place to document my journey, share what I'm learning, and get feedback from other aspiring developers.

This app allows users to sign up, create posts, comment on posts, and manage their own content. It uses handlebars for templating, Sequelize for the database, and express sessions for authentication.

Building this blog taught me how to:

Implement the MVC pattern to structure a web application
Create an authentication system to protect routes and data
Use sessions to track logged in users
Store and retrieve data from a MySQL database with Sequelize
Create relationships between models
Hash passwords before storing them
Render pages server-side with Handlebars
Overall, this project gave me hands-on experience with building a full-stack web app.
